!!! note warning "Inventory tab does not exist?"

    If the Inventory tab above does not appear, it means that your plugin was not installed correctly or that it was not active in the Project Settings, check the [Instalation](../../installation)

In this part you will see the editor empty, we will add the key file for adding any resource to the inventory system, the Inventory Database.

Choose the name of your database and Select **Ok**(Normally a simple project will have no more than one database, that is, a name like 'database' would already be suggested)

Now we can see that the editor screen has changed, showing 4 icons available in the editor, to add a new item, recipe, craft-station and category respectively.
