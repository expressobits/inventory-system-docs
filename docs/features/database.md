# Database

The database is a resource that contains all information about items, recipes, craft stations and item categories.
To use the inventory system you need to have at least one resource created in your project.
> Note: The demo already includes an example database, it is possible to use it, it is in the folder addons/inventory-system/demos/base/database.tres
